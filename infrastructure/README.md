# Infrastructure Provisioning
We are using Terraform to create the infrastructure for this pipeline:
* Google Cloud Storage bucket
* Google BigQuery dataset

To set up your own infrastructure, follow the following steps:
1. Replace the values in variables.tf with the corresponding values for your GCP project
2. Run `terraform init`
3. Run `terraform plan` to review execution plan for resources
4. If all looks good from the previous step, run `terraform apply`
5. (Optional) If anything is configured incorrectly and you need to start over: run `terraform destroy`, fix the issues, and go through steps 3 and 4 again.
